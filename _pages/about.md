I am a third-year PhD Student in Physical Oceanography (PO) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography interested in estuary-ocean interactions and their impact on biogeochemistry. I am co-advised by [Sarah Giddings](https://giddingslab.ucsd.edu/staff-members/dr-sarah-n-giddings/) and [Colleen Petrik](https://cpetrik.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/). 

Outside of deploying our moorings in the estuary, winching CTD rosettes down steep continental shelves, and debugging ROMS code, I work to engage local managers and environmental organizations with my work. Please reach out if you have questions about the local estuaries in the San Diego region! 

The best way to connect with me is by connecting with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-boatwright/) or reaching me via [e-mail](vboatwright@ucsd.edu).
